Red Portals From Cube
=====================

Custom Red Portals from Cube Recipes is possible in BaseMod v1.12.
View examples in CubeMain.txt, inside this folder.


Limitations
-----------

PlugY UberQuest is not compatible with BaseMod Custom Red Portals from Cube, because
the code for cubeMain handler conflicts with PlugY, and there can only be 1 cubemain handler.


BaseMods Custom Red Portals from Cube recipes exclude these destination levels:


Cow Level
Furnace of Pain
Forgotten Sands
Matron's Den
Uber Tristram


If you cube a portal to Act 1 you need to be in Act1 to cube it, same for Act2, etc. 
Else you will get a player sound "I cant use this yet" or "Impossible"


Custom Portals can use Act Boss quest checks and Waypoint checks, some exceptions Act2, to see if you
can cast a portal to the destination level. For example once you activate a waypoint, levels numbers below
that become active to cast a red portal to.
