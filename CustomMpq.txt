Using Custom Mpq file


BaseMod automatically looks for and loads BaseMod.mpq file if found.
BaseMod loads this custom mpq file with a higher priority than Patch_D2.mpq. 


--------------------------
Creating a custom mpq file
--------------------------


This is easy to do, using either WinMPQ or Ladik's MPQ Editor.


Ladik's MPQ Editor (simpler setup)

Some options to choose for creating new mpq:
Game Compatibility Option - Diablo II Lord of Destruction
1024 max files should be enough.

WinMPQ (Author shadowflare) I recommend using WinMPQ_VB6.zip with the vb6 runtime library.
A lot of people have issues with VB6 files in Win10.

Diablo2 listfile for use with any MPQ editor.

Beware of Daisy Chained txt files
---------------------------------


In some rare instances you can get away with including one newly compiled txt file in 
BaseMod.mpq, when the others load from Patch_D2.mpq, other times you can not. 


Inventory.bin seems to be ok by itself, but Monstats.bin, and many others are
known to be daisy chained to more than one file.


It is best practice update your MPQ's with recompiled txt files all at the same time.
That is to say, replace all the .bin files in your MPQ's at the same time, so they are synced.
