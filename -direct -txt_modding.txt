BaseMods custom mpq was not orignally created to work with -direct -txt modding. 
Versions prior to 1.13.8 do not load BaseMod.mpq with Diablo II command line options:

1) -direct
2) -direct -txt
3) -txt


-Due to a sudden and recent rise in popularity of modding this way, BaseMod.mpq has been 
updated to work with -direct -txt mode.


In BaseMod v1.13.8

BaseMod now skips loading *.bin files from BaseMod.mpq with any of the 3 command line options:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) -direct
2) -direct -txt
3) -txt


Diablo2 Log file output:


    BaseMod Installing Patches
    MPQ Loaded
    BaseMod Installing PatchesEx
    BaseMod Loaded


BaseMod.ini takes priority of ini options, in most situations, if the file is present.
Otherwise compiler built in default options will be used.



-You could expect BaseMod to load ini options from .\Diablo II\data\global\excel\BaseMod.bin
when Diablo II is loaded with command line option:


1) -direct

But I removed code for that because it will lead to more confusion.



v1.13.8 update 2 

BaseMod is updated to load ini options from BaseMod.txt and extra dll options from BaseMod.bin with 
relative path  Diablo II\data\global\excel in the following situation:

1) -direct -txt cmdline


*Extra Dlls are not loaded directly from BaseMod.txt, instead they're loaded from BaseMod.bin
because of a timing or access voilation with PlugY that leads to a crash when accessing the PlugY 
stash. This happens when PlugY.dll is loaded from BaseMod after txt files are recompiled.
